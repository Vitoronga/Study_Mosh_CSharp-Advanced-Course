# C# Advanced Course learning repo

This repo contains the projects and code created while learning advanced C# courses taught in Mosh Hamedani's course "C# Advanced Topics: Prepare for Technical Interviews". The code is separated in folders corresponding to the chapter where it was presented.

The Async/Await chapter is stored in a separate project of its own, because it is taught using WPF to better illustrate the use and impact of these functionalities.
